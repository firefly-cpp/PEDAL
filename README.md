# 🚴‍♂️ Physics-Augmented Contextual Explainer & Visual Interface for Endurance Workflows

**AST-Monitor-AI** is a companion repository to [AST-Monitor](https://github.com/firefly-cpp/AST-Monitor), focused on integrating **machine learning**, **data mining**, and **AI-powered insights** into cycling (and potentially running) performance analysis.

## 🧠 Key Goals

- Analyze session data for **performance patterns** and **fatigue signatures**
- Build **predictive models** for pacing, recovery, and training load
- Support intelligent **adaptive training plans**
- Enable **visual analytics dashboards** or coach-level summaries
- Provide modular tools that work with AST-Monitor logs or live data
